In this lab, the learning objective is for students to have a hands-on experience and in-depth understanding of Blockchain's  transactional interface.

This lab also introduces the basic concept of mining.\n\n\nLab Description: This module consists of four lab tasks: The first three labs explore the transactional and mining interface exposed by a Blockchain. The last two labs require designing client program to iterate and visualize the Blockchain transaction storage.
